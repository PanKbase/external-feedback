# Welcome to PankBase's External Feedback

Created on 2025-05-05

Goal: Use Issues and Discussion features to collect feedback on PanKbase from the the scientific community - open to all.

## I have questions or want to discuss something?

Great. You should check out the Discussions section of the website.

## I think something isn't working properly or have a suggestion on how to improve PanKbase

Post an issue. Start here and pick an appropriate issue type: https://github.com/PanKbase/external-feedback/issues 

To help guide you, issue templates are available for 1) bug reports, 2) feature requests and 3) improvements. Loosely, these will guide you towards:

1. Bug report - something is broken or not working as expected
2. Feature request - ideas for things we don't have (yet), but important to start discussions on
3. Improvement request - nothing is broken, but it may need refinement or clarification
